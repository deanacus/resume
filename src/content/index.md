## Work History

### Comparethemarket.com.au <span>2017 - present</span>

Front End Developer

#### Major Projects:

* EverPress

    I was one of two developers to build and release a new custom WordPress theme to power the marketing site for CompareTheMarket.com.au. This theme requires minimal plugins (ACF), and makes extensive use of fully custom PHP classes to provide the necessary functionality. I was brought on to help develop the JavaScript portion of the theme, but have also contributed significantly to the PHP development for the theme

* Do I Need Health Insurance? / Medicare Levy Surcharge Calculator / Lifetime Health Cover Loading Calculator

    Tasked with building three separate calculators with a consistent UI, I built a custom library in ES6 to facilitate the creation of these quizzes/calculators with ease - requiring only a single object representing the questions, and minimal custom javascript to insert the quiz into the page.

* Sergei Solutions Hub

    A knowledge base for the product categories offered by CompareTheMarket.com.au, consisting of a landing page, plus category specific knowledge base pages, and featuring on page search and search autocomplete, this was built with WordPress custom post types and vanilla JavaScript to accomplish the on page search and search autocomplete.

### Sunsuper <span>2010 - 2017</span>

Front End Developer
Content Manager
Digital Marketing Assistant

#### Major Projects:

* Public Web Design Refresh (2014) (No longer live)

    Using existing .Net codebase, making as few changes to the generated markup as possible, and working closely with a graphic designer, we took an existing fixed width site and made it responsive (with bootstrap) and uplifted the UI for the first time in 5 years.

* Member Secure Portal Design Refresh (2016)

    At short notice, we were tasked with taking our existing fixed width secure member portal (with visual design based off the pre-refresh version of the public site) and made it responsive, and uplifted the UI to match the (then) current site.

## Personal Projects

* Elysium Editor

    An experiment with Electron, a simple Markdown editor featuring:
        
        * Preview rendered markdown
        * Open/Close/Save files
        * Keyboard shortcuts for triggering the above
        * Yarn/NPM scripts to package into a compiled executable

* Webpack Starter Kit

    Another simple starting point for new projects, this time built with Webpack,allowing a quick scaffolding process in order to speed up development

* Personal Boilerplate (HTML, SASS, Gulp.js)

    A starting point for new projects, it contains a gulpfile with:

    * reusable gulp tasks, 
    * an ever-evolving SASS framework, and
    * some basic JS functions and tools, 

    plus a basic HTML file, and package.json to allow me to quickly get up and running with a new project.

* Password Generator (HTML, CSS, JS)

    Frustrated with the number of steps it takes to generate a password out of my password manager, I decided to build a tool that streamline the process.

    I built a tool that would return a random string of characters of a configurable length, from an array of acceptable characters. I also integrated an external clipboard library to allow one click copying of the password to the clipboard.

* Quit Smoking Tracker (HTML, CSS, JS)

    Built to provide me with positive feedback during the difficult phases of giving up cigarettes, this tool takes predefined values for:

    * quit date,
    * number of cigarettes per day,
    * cost per cigarette, and
    * time to smoke a cigarette.

    It then displays feedback on time since last cigarette, number of cigarettes not smoked, money saved, and time saved.

* Wedding Site template (HTML, CSS, JS)
