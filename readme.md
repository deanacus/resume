# React Boilerplate

An stupidly minimal starting point for getting up and running with a new React project nice and quickly.

# What it includes

A package.json to get you started. That's it. No prebuilt components (of any worth, anyway), no styling, no tests, ~~no~~ very few opinions.

# Get started

`yarn/npm install` - installs all the dependencies, duh!

`yarn start` spins up a webpack-dev-server

`yarn build` just bundles everything
